Hi! My name is Ray, I have built a website fictionhub[dot]io - it is a platform where authors can publish, discover, and discuss awesome fiction.

I have recently read "[]", and it was absolutely brilliant and awesome. It is exactly the kind of story I would like to see in our community, so I wanted to ask if you would like to publish it on to Fiction Hub. The story would be shared with our subscribers, and, I expect, read by about 8-12 thousand people during the next few months. I think our users will really love your story, and I would be extremely happy if you would agree to share it with our community =)

Also, if you have some time - it would be amazing if you could let me know what you think about the website. I want it to be the perfect place for people like you to share stories and hang out, so if you have any feedback about it - it would really help me to improve the project.
